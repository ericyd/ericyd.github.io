      <p>Here are some links to projects I've done.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="TODO: link">Open the Sky EP</a> (2024). In late June 2024, I
          went to a house party where a friend-of-a-friend was performing a DJ
          set. I was reminded of how much I enjoy dance music and I was inspired
          to try making some. In the previous few months I had been focused
          primarily on classical piano practice, and I wanted something more
          energetic to work on. I set a goal of finishing 4 tracks by the end of
          the year; I made it (by a hair) and submitted the album to a
          distribution service on December 29th, exactly 6 months after I
          started! As with all art, there are imperfections and things I would
          love to change, but I'm really pleased to have finished the release in
          a timely manner and call it done. I hope you enjoy!

          <a href="https://songwhip.com/usualphase/arrival">Arrival EP</a>
          (2023). This was a solo project I completed in Summer 2023. I was
          going for "upbeat funky electronica". Available on major streaming
          platforms.

        <li>
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ericyd">YouTube</a>. I've posted a
          few live performances of me playing keyboard on here in the past
          couple years (2022-2023).

          <a href="https://www.soundcloud.com/ericyd/tracks">SoundCloud</a>.
          SoundCloud is kinda my junk drawer of music, not a lot of organization
          here.

          I tried my hand at film composition a little bit in 2024. I had some
          really great experiences and a few that were not so great, so I'm not
          sure I'll be pursuring this further. I am grateful for the opportunity
          to explore this form of composition though. It pushed me in new ways
          that were enjoyable. This is the only project I've done which is
          publicly available:
