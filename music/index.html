      <p>Here are some links to projects I've done.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://songwhip.com/usualphase/arrival">Arrival EP</a>. This
          was a solo project I completed in Summer 2023. I was going for "upbeat
          funky electronica". Available on major streaming platforms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ericyd">YouTube</a>. I've posted a
          few live performances of me playing keyboard on here in the past
          couple years (2022-2023).
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.soundcloud.com/ericyd/tracks">SoundCloud</a>.
          SoundCloud is kinda my junk drawer of music, not a lot of organization
          here.

          I've been getting into film composition recently, and it's been super
          fun! I've finished scores for two films as of April 2024, and working
          on two others. One of them is available on YouTube, the other is still
          finishing post-production.
